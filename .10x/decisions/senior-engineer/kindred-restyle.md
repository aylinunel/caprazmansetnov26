# Senior-engineer pre-push review — kindred-restyle

## Push of 63fd2b4, 0abfe81 (hero), 6fb0273 (spec) — requested by the user ("push the repo")
Reviewed with the task reviewer's findings (review-ab6d208..0abfe81) as input.
- Correctness: hero renders, tests pass (logic 11/11, smoke ok). Known open defects, being fixed in round 2 (not in this push):
  band knock-out text illegible; reduced-motion frame not t=1; fonts measured before Turkish glyph subsets load.
- Clarity/simplicity: dead hero branches remain in dmMake (to be removed in round 2).
- Performance: 30 fps cap and IntersectionObserver gate present.
- Security: no new inputs; canvas text comes from the site's own data, rendered via fillText (no HTML injection); hidden paragraph uses esc().
- Karpathy check: every changed line traces to the hero/restyle request; no unrelated edits. Spec is docs only.
Decision: push as requested, with the open findings above recorded; round 2 follows in the next push.

## Push of 4d876ad, 9865df6 (hero fix rounds 2–3)
- Correctness: band text legible (≥7 dot rows), reduced-motion still frame at t=1, Inter 700/800 + Turkish glyphs awaited, header band draws joined text once. Tests: logic 11/11, smoke ok.
- Simplicity: dead hero branches removed from dmMake (Karpathy: orphans our change created, removed).
- Note: this hero is about to be replaced by the Lumen-style fog hero (user request); the dot engine stays for header bands and feed cards.
Decision: push.

## Push of c456113 (UX Task 1: fog split-card hero, ticker removed)
- Correctness: clock constants/shader match the reference; queued clicks; reduced motion instant; IO gate + 30 fps; WebGL2 fallback. Tests: logic 11/11, smoke ok (new toggle + click checks). Task review: Approved.
- Simplicity/Karpathy: old LED hero code and ticker removed (orphans of this change); no unrelated edits.
- Performance/leaks: observers not disconnected on removal (minor, deferred; guarded by alive()).
- Security: headline text goes through esc()/markText(); no new inputs.
Decision: push.

## Push of ae6a8cf (UX Task 2: tokens, Inter, chrome)
- Correctness: tokens match spec in both themes; hero colours tokenised and mixed on --k/--k2. Tests: logic 11/11, smoke ok. Task review: Approved.
- Simplicity/Karpathy: one appended override block (house style: later rules win); dead warm rules left shadowed — deferred cleanup (Task 10) rather than a sweeping delete in this task.
- Security/performance: CSS + one class name; nothing new at runtime.
Decision: push.

## Push of b7329d5, bcb795d (UX Task 3: nav names, tabs, redirects)
- Correctness: redirect table unit-tested (logic 12/12); smoke ok incl. old routes and a topic-chip filter assertion; touch targets 44px.
- Simplicity/Karpathy: tabs merged by reusing existing renderers; dead code (v3noticeEventsPage, v3sub stub) noted for Task 10 cleanup rather than removed here.
- Security: search input goes to #/ara via the existing search renderer (escaped there).
Decision: push.

## Push of 836dde9, 986f824 (UX Task 4: splits feed, feed-card dot effect)
- Correctness: weeklySplits/whatDiffers unit-tested (logic 14/14); smoke covers feed, more-button hiding, zero-event state, hover effect. Taps always navigate (wide-audience ruling).
- Simplicity/Karpathy: old 10-card grid and its stats removed (replaced by the spec's feed); appeal button no longer nested inside card links (invalid HTML).
- Performance: effect runs only on hover/focus or once per card in view on touch; off under reduced motion.
Decision: push.

## Push of 86525c1, 70cdc81, 6635d55 (UX Task 5: finding block, glossary, tables)
- Correctness: logic 15/15 (glossTerms); smoke covers popover open by tap, Tab into link, Esc close + focus return, close on navigation.
- Accessibility: popover in DOM order after its term; focus management fixed; shadow token for dark mode.
- Simplicity/Karpathy: findingBlock backward compatible (old findings render without undefined); no unrelated edits.
Decision: push.

## Push of 33f43d4 (UX Task 6: plain-language findings + tables)
- Correctness: every statistic moved into "Nasıl ölçtük?" (reviewer checked each); caveats kept; tables built from chart rows; smoke bans statistical terms in claims and checks read/table presence; logic 15/15, smoke ok. Style-claim direction verified against PCA loadings.
- Karpathy: content-only rewrite inside the finding functions; one CSS scope fix (ol.v7-read) needed by the change.
- Open (minor, logged): three wording-accuracy nits for the final pass.
Decision: push.

## Push of 62c94d3, afabf60, 0177c4d (UX Task 7: event page story-first)
- Correctness: section order enforced by smoke; bar labels measured and never clipped (smoke-checked); count line sums; null-lean sort stable; feature flag preserved. logic 15/15, smoke ok.
- Karpathy: reorders existing renderers; "Benzer başlıklar" moved, not deleted (ruling logged).
Decision: push.

## Push of decd456, 3dd0f4c, 45ee71d (UX Task 8: outlet picker, outlet page, compare)
- Correctness: outletKisaca/recentSplits/kuDat unit-tested (logic 19/19); smoke covers placed + unplaced outlet pages, compare URL, lazy rows. Unplaced outlets omit the bloc sentence (no NaN).
- Karpathy: old pgSourceV1/V2 removed because the page was rebuilt per spec; two sections restored on the user's decision; three left out.
- Security: generated sentences and restored rows escaped (esc / artRow).
Decision: push.

## Push of 7b2ff29, e19c132 (UX Task 9: dot-matrix charts, header bands, notice charts restored)
- Correctness: LED canvas drawing with overlays/interactions intact (brush lists events; crosshair tooltip works); repaint on resize, data-theme and OS scheme change; Resmî ilanlar overview charts restored (Task 3 regression) with smoke coverage. logic 19/19, smoke ok.
- Karpathy: svg CSS removed with the svg; only orphaned notice sections removed now; fully dead v3noticeEventsPage scheduled for deletion in Task 10.
Decision: push.

## Push of c552e2b, 5fde126 (UX Task 10: mobile + accessibility, deferred cleanups)
- Correctness: 44px targets ≤760px, tap-to-pin for non-navigating marks, first-tap navigation everywhere else, focus rings, contrast ≥4.5:1 both themes (contrast script), dokunun hints. logic 19/19, smoke ok (all routes, both widths/themes), contrast ok.
- Karpathy: dead code scheduled earlier removed (v3noticeEventsPage family, v3sub, duplicate NAV, xpill hack); wording-accuracy fixes limited to the logged items.
- Exemptions explicit and commented in smoke.cjs (admin route, stretched-link cards, own-scroll boxes).
Decision: push.

## Push of c357516, f536d18 (final review fix wave)
- Correctness: WebGL/listener teardown per hero instance (verified by code reading); hero = week's biggest split (same weeklySplits args as feed); recent splits need ≥20-point gap; "çoğu" only when >half of outlets share the words; kör nokta glossary matches the rule; phone header shows Benim; breadcrumb per spec. logic 21/21, smoke ok.
- Karpathy: each change traces to a final-review finding; M6/M7 accepted and left alone.
Decision: push.
